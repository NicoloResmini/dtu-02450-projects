## Deadline for hand in is no later than 3 October at 13:00

Dataset: Bike sharing 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset

REMEMBER:
- Table: % responsibility for each section (see below)
- Solution for at least four of the exam problems at the end of project1 document

1) A description of your data set.
2) A detailed explanation of the attributes of the data.
3) Data visualization(s) based on suitable visualization techniques in- cluding a principal component analysis (PCA)
4) A discussion explaining what you have learned about the data.


- For each section, you need to use something like “Student A: 60%, Student B: 30%, Student C: 10%”. For each section, one student must be more responsible than the others. See below for an example.

| Student ID   | Section 1   | Section 2   | Section 3   | Exam Question  |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| student1-id  | 30%         | 30%         | 40%         | 33.33%        |
| student2-id  | 50%         | 20%         | 30%         | 33.33%        |
| student3-id  | 20%         | 50%         | 30%         | 33.33%        |

•	You should submit the project at DTU Learn > Assignments.
•	Remember to list the contributions of each team member in the report, ideally on the front page
•	As regards the page limit, the report should be maximum 10 pages long including figures and tables (excluding frontpage, table of contents, and appendix). You can include additional plots and other information in an appendix (no page limit for the appendix); however, make sure to explicitly reference the appendix if the reader is expected to look at something specific. An extra page is allowed for answering the exam questions or you can place it as the first chapter/section in the appendix.
